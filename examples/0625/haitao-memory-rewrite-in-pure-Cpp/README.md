# Memory Management Simulator

## Overview
This project is designed to simulate and replicate a specific memory management error using C++. The primary focus is to understand how memory allocation and deallocation errors can occur and provide a basis for debugging and learning.

## Build Instructions
To build the project, you will need a C++ compiler that supports C++14. The project uses a simple Makefile for building.

```bash
make
